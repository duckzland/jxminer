## Global settings to Tune the GPU using power limits ##

[settings]
# Turn the GPU power manager on or off
enable = true

# Tuner mode can be static, dynamic or time
# - dynamic will be processed per x tick against temperature and will use the max and min value
# - time will be processed per x tick and change the value based on time against maxHour(use max value) and minHour (use min value)
# - static will only be processed when script boots and will use the max value only
mode = static

maxHour = 7

# on Nvidia GPU if level value set too high or too low
# - AMD GPU can only step up and down to predetermined level set by BIOS
# - NVidia GPU has limit of -200 (level 0) to +200 (level 100) and no change (level 50)
